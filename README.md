When it comes to approaching designing and developing software, the first step is interpreting the requirements that are listed. This is the first step to creating a functional program. Afterwards, I would then start breaking down those requirements into smaller, easier to manage sections that can be implemented. I do this by using the interpreted requirements while also putting myself in the shoes of a user and see how the code would flow from that point of view. Doing this also helps me make sure my code is both functional and secure by having me think about what a user could possibly do and make sure that whatever they input would not cause any errors in the program. I then design each section step by step resulting in both a functional and secure program.
